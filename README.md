# MPG Dataset Analysis with Python Pandas

## Overview 
This repository contains a data analysis project where I've used the MPG dataset and the Python Pandas library to analyze and explore the data. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis using Python, particularly with Pandas.

## Here are some example codes.
This code prints out the first 5 rows of data.
